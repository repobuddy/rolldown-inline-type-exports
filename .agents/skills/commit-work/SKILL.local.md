# commit-work local augmentation

## Auto-commit rule

In this repo, commit each unit of work immediately when it is complete
and verified — do not wait for the user to ask.

A unit is complete when:
- All files for that concern are written/edited
- Tests pass (pre-commit hook or manual verify)

Commit, then continue to the next unit. Never finish multiple units
before committing.
